# Electron Transport in Molecular Junction
Our project is a continuation of the [study carried out by Dr Topolnicki and coworkers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c03210).

The aim is to develop a method for predicting key factors for electron transport in molecular junction. We work on data collected from Molecular Dynamics symulations of 8000 molecular junctions. Each file contains the chemical structure of the molecule along with linkers attached to the gold electrodes on both sides. For every one of them the electron transport coefficient was calculated. Discovering the factors that increase the efficiency of the process under study will allow better junctions to be designed.
